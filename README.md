# IMDB-Trakt-Syncer
This Python script syncs user watchlist, ratings, reviews and watch history for Movies, TV Shows and Episodes both ways between [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/) and [IMDB](https://imdb.com/). Existing items will not be overwritten. Ratings, watchlist, comment/review & watch history sync are all optional. The user will be prompted to enter their settings and credentials on first run.

The script is compatible with operating systems that support Python (v3.6 or later) and Chromedriver (Windows, Linux and Mac). If you're interested in syncing ratings between Trakt, Plex, IMDB, and TMDB, I recommend the following projects: [PlexTraktSync](https://github.com/Taxel/PlexTraktSync), [IMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer), and [TMDB-Trakt-Syncer](https://github.com/RileyXX/TMDB-Trakt-Syncer). See below for my other [recommended projects](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer?tab=readme-ov-file#other-recommended-projects).

## Installation Instructions
1. Install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/) (v3.6 or later). During Python installation, tick the box for adding Python to your PATH variable. _If Python is already installed, you can skip this step._
2. Install the script by executing `python -m pip install IMDBTraktSyncer` in command line.
3. Login to [Trakt](https://trakt.tv/oauth/applications) and create a new API application named `IMDBTraktSyncer`. In the "Redirect uri" field, enter `urn:ietf:wg:oauth:2.0:oob`, then save the application.
4. Run the script by executing `IMDBTraktSyncer` in the command line.
5. Follow the prompts during the first run. You will need to enter your Trakt `client ID` and `client secret` from step 3, as well as your IMDB `username` and `password`. Please note that these details are saved insecurely as `credentials.txt` in the same folder as the script. It is recommended to change your IMDB password to something unique beforehand.
6. Setup is complete. The script will continue running and syncing your ratings. You can monitor its progress in the command line. See below for [setting up automation](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer?tab=readme-ov-file#for-setting-up-automation-see-the-following-wiki-pages).

## Troubleshooting, Known Issues, Workarounds & Future Outlook
- If any of your details change (passwords, logins, API keys, etc.), simply run `IMDBTraktSyncer --clear-user-data` to reset your credentials. Alternatively, open `credentials.txt`, modify your details, save it and then run the script again. You can also simply delete `credentials.txt` to reset the script and it will prompt you to enter your new details on the next run.
- If IMDB requires a captcha on login, and you see "Not signed in" appear in the script, the captcha is likely the cause. To fix this, navigate to the IMDB website in your browser (preferably Chrome) from the same computer. If you're already logged in, log out and log back in. It may ask you to fill in a captcha. Complete the captcha and finish logging in. After successfully logging in on your browser, run the script again, and it should work. You may need to repeat this step several times if the issue persists. Adding a captcha solver to the script is being considered but not currently implemented. [Issue #2](https://github.com/RileyXX/IMDB-Trakt-Syncer/issues/2)
- Due to IMDB's lack of API and rating import ability, this script uses an unconventional method that mimics using a web browser to set ratings on IMDB. Therefore, there are many points of failure that could arise. The script will be updated as best as possible.
